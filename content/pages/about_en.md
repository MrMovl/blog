Hi there

Let me tell you a little bit about myself, so you can decide how much weight you give my words.

My name is Tomke Reibisch and I like to create stuff. Also I am always interested to find out how something works, no matter what it is. Like many before me, this drew me to the field of programming (with little detours). Nothing grants more power to someone how likes to create stuff then the programming technologies of our time. Except maybe Minecraft.

Like with all aspects of my life my interests in regards to software engineering cover a broad spectrum of topics. Some core fields are:
- Functional programming, because this reflects the way my brain works perfectly
- Code quality, because unreadable code is just rude
- Diversity of programming languages, because I believe there is a right tool for every problem

Lately I've also been interested in some more specialized topics:
- Remote work, more precisely the technologies that support asynchronous communication
- UX Design, because clean code doesn't help an ugly product
- Data visualization and processing

I am currently working with the [graphomate GbmH](http://www.graphomate.com/) creating tool to create meaningful visualizations with business data.

In addition to programming I am interested in farming my own vegetables, woodworking, cats, roleplaying games, linux, science, literature, philosophy ... You can see where this is headed. This vastness of this list should make it abundantly clear that I am not an expert in any of these hobbies. But that is not my goal anyway.

Also, I am not taking myself too serious some time, so maybe you shouldn't either.
