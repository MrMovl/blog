# Static sites are simple sites

## What this was supposed to be
In the past I set up and maintained another blog. Back then I had heard about the [ghost blogging engine](http://ghost.org) and gave that a try. I liked the _no nonsense_ claim. I remember that setting it up was quite the hassle, but it was my first and I thought this was supposed to be hard. And I was very pleased with the result. Writing and publishing articles is great with ghost. The available themes are very pretty. And everything feels slim and lightweight. For this blog I wanted to use the now much more mature version of ghost, thinking that by now setup was probably not that bad anymore. After a few hours of trying and failing I was fed up. Ghost is build with node, so I should have known. Don't get me wrong, I still think it is a great platform if you want to write and publish and get out their with a great UI and writing experience. Just don't set one up yourself.

## What this is
And again [Gregor](www.gregor.codes) came to the rescue. His new blog was made using the static site generator [pelican](http://getpelican.org), written in python. I liked the idea of static site generators, but didn't want to ssh into my server all the time to deploy new articles. On the other hand python is great, and I had this blog set up in under one hour. Some minor troubles with the theme, but I guess I will build my own anyway.

## What this will become
Here comes the funny part. I actually planed on writing my own blogging engine, because I wanted to build some bigger project in [Elm](www.elm-lang.org). I will elaborate on that thought in more detail [here]().
