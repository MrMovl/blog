# Motivation

From time to time I have some interesting thoughts, at least interesting to me. And what is the purpose of a blog if not to write them down somewhere so you feel safe that they are not wasted, without them neccessarily making any impact. Which is fine.

So this time I had a thought while reading the Lord of the Rings. It is interlaced with a lot of small poems or other lyrical devices. From that wording you probably already get that I do not know much about literature and lyrics in a formal way. I do appreciate good lyrics and am still thinking about a web platform for them, which needs to exists, but I can't tell you anything about the kind of poem I see anywhere.
