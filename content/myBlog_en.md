Title: This is my blog

So this is my blog now. As many before me, I had planed to create a blog for quite some time. And my reasons are probably not very unique.

Most of the time it is because there are some thoughts in my head that need to get out. During my extensive consumption of podcast I can not help but create ideas like a faucet. And because programming seems to lie between science and art (regarding the creative process) this should be reason enough. You may have heard, that good art is just something that needed to get out of the artists mind. And in my view the most important scientific thoughts are the ones you need to share with others.
 
Another reason is that I feel that I need to make myself more visible in this digital age. Also by choice, but mainly by inevitability, I count myself as a member of the group that inhibits and forms the internet. I don't care what you call them, but I always wanted to learn how you spell *bohème*, so I am going with digital bohème ;). And by *internet* I mean websites hosted on a vast array of servers which are linked by their hyperlinks. Not walled gardens enclosed for dubious reasons.

But enough of this, I actually wanted to talk about the technology used here...
